# Analyzing data with pandas

In these exercises I'm analyzing data on animals and billionaire data from Bloomberg 2014 (from animals.csv and richpeople.xlsx). 

I'm doing a lot of pandas analysis in python as well as some chart creation in Python and MatPlotLib. I even gave Altair for scatterplots a try!
